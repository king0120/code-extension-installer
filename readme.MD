# VS Code extension installer (Node.js)

Are you tired of manually installing your friend's new cool extensions?
Ask him/her to type `code --list-extensions` in the terminal, copy the list, paste it in `extensions.txt` and proceed
to run `npm start` inside the `CodeExtensionInstaller` directory.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- VS Code (Code CLI)

## Errors

You might come across `⚠️ Please check author.extension`, don't be worried. The plugin you're trying to install
might not exist or (hopefully) has already been installed, just verify it yourself and manually remove it from the list! :)
